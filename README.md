## Spinning Conworld
Just a way to play with three.js by creating an interactive globe of a fledgling conworld. Don't mind the art. It's still a work in progress. The code is heavily commented in order to take notes.

To see it, click [here](https://gracefuljs.github.io/conworld-projects-planet/). Click and drag the globe to spin it around!
